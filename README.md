My Neo4j


## My Neo4j project (with Python, Azure)

Built a knowledge-based ontology graph application for a federal government client

- Collected corpus from various sources and classified with levels.
- Converted relational data to Neo4j Graph Database.
- Created rules and used RDF to describe the resources.
- Imported results to Neo4j with Neo4j Browser and Cypher Query Language.
- Visualized the ontology knowledge graphs with Neo4j Bloom and search phrases.
- Imported Wikidata into Neo4j with Wikidata Query Service and SPARQL HTTP endpoint to retrieve information on particular areas.
- Used Python NLP libraries and Azure Cognitive Services APIs to analyse data, extracted entities, key phrases, and categories, then do sentiment analysis with data science algorithms in Jupyter Notebook.
- Used Protégé to edit ontology and publish OWL files to WebProtégé.
